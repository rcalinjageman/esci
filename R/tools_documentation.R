#' #' Charles Honorton. Bem not only judged them adequate, but joined the research

#' #' reviewed early ganzfeld studies and described how the experimental procedure
#' #' had been improved to reduce the chance that results could be influenced by
#' #' various possible biases, or leakages of information from sender to receiver.
#' #' For example, the randomization procedure was carried out automatically by
#' #' computer, and all stimuli were presented under computer control. Bem and
#' #' Honorton then presented data from studies conducted with the improved
#' #' procedure. Table 13.1 presents basic data from 10 studies reported by Bem and

#' #' example, 22 participants responded, with 8 of them giving a correct response.

#' #' matters most: 'Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent
#' #' are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10
#' #' years' (p. 363). This view was enormously popularized by Malcolm Gladwell
#' #' (2008), who argued in his book Outliers that 10,000 hours of focused practice
#' #' is the key to achieving expertise. However, this view is now being
#' #' challenged, with one important contribution being a large meta-analysis of
#' #' correlations between amount of intense practice and level of achievement:
#' #' Macnamara et al. (2014) combined 157 correlations reported in a wide range of
#' #' fields, from sports to music and education, and found correlation of only r =
#' #' .35 (.30, .39). Table 11.1 shows the 16 main correlations for music, from

#' "#' You've probably seen cross sections of the brain with
#' #' brightly colored areas indicating which brain regions are most active during
#' #' a particular type of cognition or emotion. Search online for fMRI (functional
#' #' magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans to see such pictures and learn how
#' #' they are made. They can be fascinating-are we at last able to see how
#' #' thinking works? In 2008, McCabe and Castel published studies that
#' #' investigated how adding a brain picture might alter judgments of the
#' #' credibility of a scientific article. For one group of participants, an
#' #' article was accompanied by a brain image that was irrelevant to the article.
#' #' For a second, independent group, there was no image. Participants read the
#' #' article, then gave a rating of the statement 'The scientific reasoning in the
#' #' article made sense'. The response options were 1 (strongly disagree), 2
#' #' (disagree), 3 (agree), and 4 (strongly agree). The researchers reported that
#' #' mean ratings were higher with a brain picture than without, but that the
#' #' difference was small. It seemed that an irrelevant brain picture may have
#' #' some, but only a small influence. The authors drew appropriately cautious
#' #' conclusions, but the result quickly attracted attention and there were many
#' #' media reports that greatly overstated it. At least according to the popular
#' #' media, it seemed that adding a brain picture made any story convincing.
#' #' Search on 'McCabe seeing is believing', or similar, to find media reports and
#' #' blog posts. Some warned readers to watch out for brain pictures, which, they
#' #' said, can trick you into believing things that aren't true. The result
#' #' intrigued some New Zealander colleagues of mine who discovered that, despite
#' #' its wide recognition, the finding hadn't been replicated. They ran
#' #' replication studies using the materials used by the original researchers, and
#' #' found generally small ESs. I joined the team at the data analysis stage and
#' #' the research was published (Michael et al., 2013). I'll discuss here a
#' #' meta-analysis of two of the original studies and eight replications by our

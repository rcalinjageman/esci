#' Estimate standardized mean difference (Cohen's d) for an independent groups
#' contrast
#'
#'
#' @description \loadmathjax  `CI_smd_ind_contrast` returns the point estimate
#'   and confidence interval for a standardized mean difference (smd aka Cohen's
#' *d* aka Hedges *g*). A standardized mean difference is a difference in means standardized
#'   to a standard deviation:
#'   \mjdeqn{d = \frac{ \psi }{s}}{d = psi/s}
#'
#'
#' @param means A vector of 2 or more means
#' @param sds A vector of standard deviations, same length as means
#' @param ns A vector of sample sizes, same length as means
#' @param contrast A vector of group weights, same length as means
#'
#' @param conf_level The confidence level for the confidence interval, in
#'   decimal form.  Defaults to 0.95.
#' @param assume_equal_variance Defaults to FALSE
#' @param correct_bias Defaults to TRUE; attempts to correct the slight upward
#'   bias in d derived from a sample.  As of 8/9/2023 - Bias correction
#'   has been added for more than 2 groups when equal variance is not
#'   assumed, based on recent updates to statpsych
#'
#'
#' @return Returns a list with these named elements:
#' * effect_size - the point estimate from the sample
#' * lower - lower bound of the CI
#' * upper - upper bound of the CI
#' * numerator - the numerator for Cohen's d_biased;
#'   the mean difference in the contrast
#' * denominator - the denominator for Cohen's d_biased;
#'   if equal variance is assumed this is sd_pooled, otherwise sd_avg
#' * df - the degrees of freedom used for correction and CI calculation
#' * se - the standard error of the estimate; **warning** not totally
#'   sure about this yet
#' * moe - margin of error; 1/2 length of the CI
#' * d_biased - Cohen's d without correction applied
#' * properties - a list of properties for the result
#'
#'   Properties
#' * effect_size_name - if equal variance assumed d_s, otherwise d_avg
#' * effect_size_name_html - html representation of d_name
#' * denominator_name - if equal variance assumed sd_pooled otherwise sd_avg
#' * denominator_name_html - html representation of denominator name
#' * bias_corrected - TRUE/FALSE if bias correction was applied
#' * message - a message explaining denominator and correction status

#' @section Details:
#' ## It's a bit complicated ##
#' A standardized mean difference turns out to be complicated.
#'
#' First, it has many names:
#' * standardized mean difference (smd)
#' * Cohen's *d*
#' * When bias in a sample d has been corrected, also called Hedge's *g*
#'
#'
#' Second, the choice of the standardizer requires thought:
#' * sd_pooled - used when assuming all groups have exact same variance
#' * sd_avg - does not require assumption of equal variance
#' * other possibilities, too, but not dealt with in this function
#'
#'
#' The choice of standardizer is important, so it's noted in the subscript:
#' * d_s -- assumes equal variance, standardized to sd_pooled
#' * d_avg - does not assume equal variance, standardized to sd_avg
#'
#'
#' A third complication is the issue of bias: d estimated from a sample has a
#' slight upward bias at smaller sample sizes.  With total sample size > 30,
#' this slight bias becomes fairly negligible (kind of like the small upward
#' bias in a sample standard deviation).
#'
#' This bias can be corrected when equal variance is assumed or when the
#' design of the study is simple (2 groups).  For complex designs (>2 groups)
#' without the assumption of equal variance, there is now also an
#' approximate approach to correcting bias from Bonett.
#'
#' Corrections for bias produce a long-run reduction in average bias.
#' Corrections for bias are approximate.
#'
#'
#' ## How are d and its CI calculated? ##
#'
#' ### When equal variance is assumed ###
#' When equal variance is assumed, the standardized mean difference is
#' d_s, defined in Kline, p. 196:
#'
#'  \mjdeqn{ d_s = \frac{ \psi }{ sd_{pooled} } }{ d_s = psi / sd_s}
#'
#'
#' where psi is defined in Kline, equation 7.8:
#'
#' \mjdeqn{ \psi =\sum_{i=1}^{a}c_iM_i }{psi = sum(contrasts*means)}
#'
#'
#' and where sd_pooled is defined in Kline, equation 3.11
#' \mjdeqn{sd_{pooled} = { \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{a} (n_i -1) s_i^2 } { \sum_{i=1}^{a} (n_i-1) } }}{sqrt(sum(variances*dfs) / sum(dfs))}
#'
#'
#' The CI for d_s is derived from lambda-prime transformation from Lecoutre,
#' 2007 with code adapted from Cousineau & Goulet-Pelletier, 2020. Kelley,
#' 2007 explains the general approach for linear contrasts.
#'
#' This approach to generating the CI is 'exact', meaning coverage should be
#' as desired *if* all assumptions are met (ha!).
#'
#' Correction of upward bias can be applied.
#'
#'
#' ### When equal variance is not assumed ###
#' When equal variance is not
#' assumed, the standardized mean difference is d_avg, defined in Bonett,
#' equation 6:
#'
#' \mjdeqn{ d_{avg} = \frac{ \psi }{ sd_{avg} }}{ d_avg = psi / sd_avg}
#'
#' Where sd_avg is the square root of the average of the group variances, as
#' given in Bonett, explanation of equation 6:
#'
#' \mjdeqn{sd_{avg} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{a} s_i^2 }{ a } }}{sqrt(mean(variances))}
#'
#'
#' #### If only 2 groups ####
#' * The CI is derived from lambda-prime transformation
#'   using df and se from Huynh, 1989 -- see especially Delacre et al., 2021
#' * This is also an 'exact' approach, and correction can be applied
#'
#'
#' #### If more than 2 groups ####
#' * CI is approximated using the approach from Bonett, 2008
#' * An approximate correction developed by Bonett is used

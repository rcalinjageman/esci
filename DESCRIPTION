Title: Estimation Statistics with Confidence Intervals
Version: 0.9.1
Author: Robert J Calin-Jageman
Maintainer: Robert J Calin-Jageman <rcalinjageman@dom.edu>
Description: An r package and jamovi module for the estimation approach 
    to inferential statistics, the approach which emphasizes effect sizes, 
    interval estimates, and meta-analysis. Nearly all functions
    are based on statpsych or metafor.  This package is still under active
    development, and breaking changes are likely, especially with the
    plot and hypothesis test functions.  If you need a stable and
    production-ready approach for confidence intervals, use
    statpsych.  Please Post issues, bugs, and feature requests 
    to <https://github.com/rcalinjageman/esci>.

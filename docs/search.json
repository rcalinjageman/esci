Then all once again gave reliability and\r\nconfidence ratings for the 18 tweets.\r\ndecade earlier, had been one of several outside experts invited to scrutinize\r\nthe laboratory and experimental procedures of parapsychology researcher\r\nCharles Honorton. Bem not only judged them adequate, but joined the research\r\neffort and became a coauthor with Honorton. Bem and Honorton (1994) first\r\nreviewed early ganzfeld studies and described how the experimental procedure\r\nhad been improved to reduce the chance that results could be influenced by\r\nvarious possible biases, or leakages of information from sender to receiver.\r\nFor example, the randomization procedure was carried out automatically by\r\ncomputer, and all stimuli were presented under computer control. Bem and\r\nHonorton then presented data from studies conducted with the improved\r\nprocedure. Table 13.1 presents basic data from 10 studies reported by Bem and\r\nHonorton (1994). Participants each made a single judgment, so in Pilot 1, for\r\nexample, 22 participants responded, with 8 of them giving a correct response.\r\nThree pilot studies helped refine the procedures, then four studies used\r\nnovice receivers. Study 5 used 20 students of music, drama, or dance as\r\nreceivers, in response to suggestions that creative people might be more\r\nlikely to show telepathy. Studies 6 and 7 used receivers who had participated\r\nin an earlier study. The proportion of hits expected by chance is .25, and\r\nTable 13.1 shows that all but Study 1 found proportions higher than .25.\r\nwho identified as female.  Data is Subjective Wellbeing abd Body Satisfaction.\r\nwho identified as male.

Brethel-Haurwitz and Marsh (2014)\r\nexamined this idea by collecting data on U.S. states. A Gallup poll in 2010\r\nwas used to measure each state's well-being index, a measure of mean\r\nhappiness for the state's residents on a scale from 0 to 100. Next, a kidney\r\ndonation database for 1999-2010 was used to figure out each state's rate\r\n(number of donations per 1 million people) of non-directed kidney\r\ndonations-that's giving one kidney to a stranger, an extremely generous and\r\naltruistic thing to do!\r\ntheir classic study, Jacowitz and Kahneman (1995) asked participants to\r\nestimate how many babies are born each day in the United States. Participants\r\nwere given either a low anchor (more than 100 babies/day) or a high anchor\r\n(less than 50,000 babies/day). Those who saw the low anchor estimated many\r\nfewer births/day than those who saw the high anchor, which suggests that the\r\nwording can have a profound influence. The correct answer, as it happens, is\r\n~11,000 births/day in 2014. To investigate the extent that these results are\r\nreplicable, the Many Labs project repeated this classic study at many\r\ndifferent labs around the world. You can find the summary data for 30 of\r\nthese labs in the Anchor Estimate ma data file\r\nnumerous other issues can be highly damaging, but are thriving in this social\r\nmedia age. Trying to debunk a conspiracy theory by presenting facts and\r\nevidence often doesn't work, alas. Psychological inoculation, also similar to\r\nprebunking, presents a mild form of misinformation, preferably with\r\nexplanation, in the hope of building resistance to real-life fake news-a sort\r\nof vaccine for fake news. The Bad News game is a spin-off from research on\r\npsychological inoculation. Basol et al. (2020) assessed the possible\r\neffectiveness of this game as a fake news vaccine. At getbadnews.com you can\r\nclick 'About' for information, or just start playing the game- it's easy and\r\nmaybe even fun. You encounter mock Twitter (now X) fake news messages that\r\nillustrate common strategies for making fake news memorable or believable.\r\nYou make choices between messages and decide which ones to 'forward' as you\r\ntry to spread fake news while building your credibility score and number of\r\n'followers'-rather like real life for a conspiracy theorist wanting to spread\r\nthe word. Compete with your friends for credibility and number of followers.\r\nBasol's online participants first saw 18 fictitious fake news tweets and\r\nrated each for reliability (accuracy, believability), and also rated their\r\nconfidence in that reliability rating. Both ratings were on a 1 to 7 scale.\r\nThose in the BadNews group then played the game for 15 minutes, whereas those\r\nin the Control group played Tetris. Then all once again gave reliability and\r\nconfidence ratings for the 18 tweets.\r\ndecade earlier, had been one of several outside experts invited to scrutinize\r\nthe laboratory and experimental procedures of parapsychology researcher\r\nCharles Honorton. Bem not only judged them adequate, but joined the research\r\neffort and became a coauthor with Honorton. Bem and Honorton (1994) first\r\nreviewed early ganzfeld studies and described how the experimental procedure\r\nhad been improved to reduce the chance that results could be influenced by\r\nvarious possible biases, or leakages of information from sender to receiver.\r\nFor example, the randomization procedure was carried out automatically by\r\ncomputer, and all stimuli were presented under computer control. Bem and\r\nHonorton then presented data from studies conducted with the improved\r\nprocedure. Table 13.1 presents basic data from 10 studies reported by Bem and\r\nHonorton (1994). Participants each made a single judgment, so in Pilot 1, for\r\nexample, 22 participants responded, with 8 of them giving a correct response.\r\nThree pilot studies helped refine the procedures, then four studies used\r\nnovice receivers. Study 5 used 20 students of music, drama, or dance as\r\nreceivers, in response to suggestions that creative people might be more\r\nlikely to show telepathy. Studies 6 and 7 used receivers who had participated\r\nin an earlier study. The proportion of hits expected by chance is .25, and\r\nTable 13.1 shows that all but Study 1 found proportions higher than .25.\r\nwho identified as female.

To what extent can\r\nrecent emotional experiences influence moral judgments? Schnall et al. (2008)\r\nexamined this question by manipulating feelings of cleanliness and purity and\r\nthen observing the extent that this changes how harshly participants judge\r\nthe morality of others. Inscho Study 1, Schnall et al. asked participants to\r\ncomplete a word scramble task with either neutral words (neutral prime) or\r\nwords related to cleanliness (cleanliness prime). All students then completed\r\na set of moral judgments about controversial scenarios: Moral judgment is the\r\naverage of six items, each rated on a scale from 0 to 9, with high meaning\r\nharsh.

once. Expt 4 was conducted online with participants recruited from Amazon's
Mechanical Turk, who are typically more diverse than students. The online
task was based on a mirror-drawing game developed by Bob and students (Cusack
et al., 2015, tiny.cc/bobmirrortrace). Participants first read a description
of the game and the scoring procedure. To play, you use your computer
trackpad to trace a target line, as accurately and quickly as you can. The
task is tricky because you can see only a mirror image of the path you are
tracing with a finger on the trackpad. A running score is displayed. The
final score is the percentage match between the target line and the path you
traced, so scores can range from 0 to 100"><meta property="og:description" content="Suppose you want to change the battery in your phone, cook the perfect

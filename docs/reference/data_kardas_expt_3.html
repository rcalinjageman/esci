once. In Expt 3, participants first watched a brief video of a person
performing the moonwalk. The Low Exposure group watched the video once, the
High Exposure group 20 times. Then participants predicted, on a 1 to 10
scale, how well they felt they would be able to perform the moonwalk
themselves. Finally, they attempted a single performance of the moonwalk,
which was videoed. These videos were rated, on the same 1 to 10 scale, by
independent raters."><meta property="og:description" content="Suppose you want to change the battery in your phone, cook the perfect

  This module is for estimation, providing analyses that focus on effect sizes,
  uncertainty, and meta-analysis.  The estimates provided are frequentist and
  are based on the <a href =
  "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/statpsych/index.html" target =
  "_blank"> statpsych</a> package by Doug Bonett.</br>


  This is a complete rewrite from the prevoius release, breaking previous
  analyses.  If you need the previous version, you can download and sideload it
